# NineGeneticAlgorithm
Genetic algorithm designed to play the malaysian card game nine. 
The inspiration for this algorithm stemmed from the fact that there does not exists any information regarding odds charts or game theory relating to Nine. After thorough online research, it seemed the only way to know which strategies would be optimal for this game, was to use the brilliance of AI along with Google Collaboratory's GPUs to simulate games. The algorithm uses a random single gene crossover with random mutation for its "players", who are assigned random genes(traits) from their inception. Once players are initialized they play against a dealer, whose strategy is preset, with the aim of making the most "money" possible over hundreds of hands. The top two performers of each population are used to repopulate the next generation in order to repeat the process hundreds of thousands of times. After all games are simulated, the top performers genes are outputted as well as the amount of money they made against the dealer.
